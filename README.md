# Description
Project Pink is a web app which crowdsources the locations of free menstrual products, allowing vulnerable populations to access these necessary resources. It was initially created for StarterHacks 2020. This repo contains an updated version of the project with improved UI and API integrations, building upon the basic structure of the original beyond the hackathon.
